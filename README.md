# picaday
A simple webpage that displays a random picture everyday from a collection of images.

## Briefing
In this repo, we will create a simple page that will load one picture everyday from a collection of photography for every day of the year. A selection of 366 photographs (an extra one for leap years) will be provided by Joshua Robinson in .jpg format.

### Requirements
- [ ] The website must display a different picture every day of the year.
- [ ] It should be able to display basic information about the photo such as location and date the picture was taken.
- [ ] It should be able to display photographs in a portrait or landscape orientation.
- [ ] It must be completely random.
- [ ] It cannot display the same picture twice in a year.
- [ ] Once it completes a year, it must loop back through and repeat the process.

### Tasks
- [ ] Code the HTML page that will host the picture frame.
- [ ] Style the gallery page with a CSS file.
- [ ] Write the JS script file that will dynamically load new pictures.

### HTML
- [ ] Create a header with a nice name for the gallery.
- [ ] Create a frame that will hold the daily picture.
- [ ] Create a sidebar to display basic information about the daily picture.

### CSS
- [ ] Make sure the site is responsive for mobile phone and tablet.
- [ ] Ensure that the picture frame can hold landscape and portrait images.
- [ ] Style the sidebar so that it is readable but doesn't take attention away from the picture.

### Javascript
- [ ] Create the array variables that will track which photographs have been displayed, and which are yet to be displayed.
- [ ] Write a function that changes the ```<img src="XXX.jpg>``` tag dynamically as the date changes.
